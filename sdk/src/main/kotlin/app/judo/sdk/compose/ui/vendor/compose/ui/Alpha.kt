/**
 * Draw content with modified alpha that may be less than 1.
 *
 * Usage of this API renders this composable into a separate graphics layer.
 * Note when an alpha less than 1.0f is provided, contents are implicitly clipped
 * to their bounds. This is because an intermediate compositing layer is created to
 * render contents into first before being drawn into the destination with the desired alpha.
 * This layer is sized to the bounds of the composable this modifier is configured on, and contents
 * outside of these bounds are omitted.
 *
 * @see graphicsLayer
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @sample androidx.compose.ui.samples.AlphaSample
 *
 * @param alpha the fraction of children's alpha value and must be between `0` and `1`, inclusive.
